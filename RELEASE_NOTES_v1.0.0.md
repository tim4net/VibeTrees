# Vibe Worktrees v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Production Ready

---

## üéâ What is Vibe Worktrees?

Vibe Worktrees is a developer tool that enables truly parallel feature development by managing multiple git worktrees, each with its own AI assistant, browser-based terminal, and isolated service containers. No more context switching, port conflicts, or manual environment setup.

## üöÄ Major Features

### 1. Multi-Worktree Orchestration
- **One-click worktree creation** from web UI
- **Automatic directory structure** (`.worktrees/feature-name/`)
- **Port registry** ensures no conflicts between worktrees
- **Safe deletion** prevents accidental main branch removal

### 2. AI Agent Support
- **Claude Code**: Fully supported with MCP integration
- **Codex**: Ready for when CLI becomes available
- **Gemini**: Ready for when CLI becomes available
- **Shell**: Always available fallback

Each worktree can run a different agent with isolated context.

### 3. Container Isolation (Docker/Podman)
- **Automatic port allocation** per worktree
- **Persistent port registry** (`~/.vibetrees/ports.json`)
- **Dual runtime support**: Docker Compose and Podman Compose
- **Service health monitoring** and status display

### 4. Git Sync & Smart Reload
- **Automatic change detection** after syncing with main
- **Smart dependency installation** (npm, pip, bundle, cargo, etc.)
- **Database migration runner** (Prisma, Sequelize, Django, Rails, etc.)
- **Selective service restart** (only affected services, not all)
- **AI agent notifications** of important changes

### 5. AI-Assisted Conflict Resolution
- **Auto-resolution** for simple cases:
  - Whitespace-only conflicts
  - Dependency version bumps
  - Non-overlapping config changes
- **AI assistance** for complex conflicts:
  - Formatted conflict info sent to agent
  - Resolution suggestions
  - Comprehensive prompts for review

### 6. MCP Server Integration
- **Auto-discovery** from 3 sources:
  - Local project servers (`./mcp-servers/`)
  - npm project dependencies
  - Global npm packages
- **Auto-configuration** with environment variables
- **Vibe Bridge** server for cross-worktree communication
- **Official servers** supported out-of-the-box

### 7. Web-Based Interface
- **Browser UI** with responsive design
- **Real-time terminal** access (xterm.js)
- **WebSocket** communication for live updates
- **PWA support** for offline use
- **Network mode** (`--listen`) for remote access

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Parallel Feature Development
Work on multiple features simultaneously without context switching:
- Feature A in worktree 1 (Claude agent, ports 3000-3001)
- Feature B in worktree 2 (Codex agent, ports 3002-3003)
- Bugfix in worktree 3 (Gemini agent, ports 3004-3005)

### 2. Code Review Without Context Loss
Review PRs in separate worktrees while keeping your current work active:
- Main work in worktree 1
- PR review in worktree 2
- Switch between browser tabs, no restart needed

### 3. Experimentation
Try risky changes in isolated worktrees:
- Experiment in worktree 1 (safe to delete)
- Main work unaffected in primary worktree
- No fear of breaking your environment

### 4. Team Onboarding
New team members get instant environments:
- Clone repo
- Run `npm run web`
- Create worktree for their first task
- AI agent guides them through codebase

---

## üöß Known Limitations

1. **Docker/Podman required** - Cannot run without container runtime (services optional)
2. **Single machine** - No team collaboration features in v1.0 (coming in v2.0)
3. **Memory usage** - Each worktree is a full checkout (~300MB for 3 worktrees on 100MB repo)
4. **Agent CLIs** - Only Claude Code officially released, Codex and Gemini await CLI availability

---

## üîÆ Roadmap (v2.0)

### Planned Features

- **Terminal persistence** - Browser refresh doesn't kill terminals
- **Team collaboration** - Shared worktrees with Supabase backend
- **Cloud integration** - Deploy from worktree to staging/production
- **VS Code extension** - Native IDE integration
- **Mobile responsive UI** - Use from tablets/phones
