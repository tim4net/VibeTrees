# Network Access Configuration

## Overview

VibeTrees supports two modes:

- **Local Mode** (default): Only accessible from `localhost` - safe and secure
- **Network Mode** (`--listen`): Accessible from any device on your network - great for team collaboration

## Using Network Mode

```bash
# Start with network access
vibe --listen
```

You'll see all available network interfaces:

```
üöÄ Worktree Manager is running!

   üì° Network Mode: Listening on ALL interfaces (--listen)

   Connect from any device on your network:

      üåê http://192.168.1.100:3335  (en0)
      üåê http://172.16.0.1:3335     (en1)
```

## macOS Firewall

### Automatic Configuration (Unmanaged Macs)

On unmanaged Macs, VibeTrees will automatically configure the firewall:

1. Detects if node is blocked by macOS Firewall
2. Prompts for `sudo` password
3. Adds node to firewall allowed list
4. Unblocks incoming connections

```
   üîì Configuring macOS firewall for network access...
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è  This requires administrator privileges (sudo)

   [sudo password prompt]

   ‚úÖ Firewall configured successfully!
```

### Manual Configuration (Managed Macs)

If your Mac is managed by your organization, you'll see:

```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  This Mac is managed by your organization
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Firewall settings must be configured manually:

   1. Open System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy
   2. Click the "Firewall" tab
   3. Click the lock icon üîí and authenticate
   4. Click "Firewall Options..."
   5. Click the "+" button to add an application
   6. Navigate to: /usr/local/bin/node
   7. Select "Allow incoming connections"
   8. Click "OK"

   üí° If you cannot modify firewall settings, contact your IT department
```

**Why managed Macs are different**: Enterprise-managed Macs have firewall policies enforced by MDM (Mobile Device Management). Command-line tools cannot override these policies.

## Linux Firewall

### UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3335/tcp
```

### Firewalld (Fedora/CentOS/RHEL)

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3335/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Windows Firewall

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Advanced settings"
3. Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
4. Select "Port" ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí 3335
5. Select "Allow the connection"
6. Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
7. Name the rule "VibeTrees"

## Security Considerations

### When to Use Network Mode

‚úÖ **Safe scenarios**:
- Home network behind router NAT
- Trusted corporate network
- VPN-only access
- Development environment with team

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risky scenarios**:
- Public WiFi (coffee shops, airports)
- Networks you don't control
- Open/unsecured networks

### Best Practices

1. **Use local mode by default** - Only enable `--listen` when you need network access
2. **Know your network** - Understand who can access your network
3. **Use VPN** - For remote team access, use VPN instead of exposing to internet
4. **Firewall is your friend** - Keep firewall enabled, only allow specific apps
5. **Monitor connections** - Check who's connected: `netstat -an | grep 3335`

### What's Exposed?

When using `--listen`, VibeTrees exposes:
- Web UI for managing worktrees
- Terminal access to your worktrees
- Git operations on your repositories
- Docker service management

**Important**: VibeTrees does NOT:
- Authenticate users (anyone on network can access)
- Encrypt traffic (uses HTTP, not HTTPS)
- Log access attempts
- Rate limit requests

For production team use, consider:
- Setting up a VPN
- Adding authentication proxy (nginx with basic auth)
- Using SSH tunneling instead of `--listen`

## Troubleshooting

### Still can't connect from other devices?

1. **Verify server is listening on all interfaces**:
   ```bash
   netstat -an | grep 3335
   # Should show: *.3335 or 0.0.0.0.3335
   ```

2. **Check firewall status**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
   /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getappblocked $(which node)
   ```

3. **Test with curl from another device**:
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.1.100:3335
   # Should return HTML (not connection refused)
   ```

4. **Check router/network**:
   - Some routers block communication between wireless clients (AP isolation)
   - Corporate networks may have additional firewall rules
   - Try connecting from same subnet first

### Common Issues

**"Connection refused"**
- Firewall is blocking connections
- Follow manual configuration steps above

**"No route to host"**
- Device is on different network/subnet
- Check both devices are on same WiFi network

**"Connection timeout"**
- Router has AP isolation enabled
- Corporate firewall is blocking traffic
- Try connecting from wired device

**"Address already in use"**
- Port 3335 is already taken
- Use `--port 3336` to choose different port

## Alternative: SSH Tunneling

For secure remote access without `--listen`:

```bash
# On remote machine
ssh -L 3335:localhost:3335 user@server-ip

# Then open browser to localhost:3335
```

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Encrypted traffic (SSH)
- ‚úÖ Authentication (SSH keys)
- ‚úÖ No firewall changes needed
- ‚úÖ Works through NAT/firewalls

## Summary

- **Local mode** (default): Secure, localhost-only access
- **Network mode** (`--listen`): Team collaboration on trusted networks
- **Automatic firewall**: Works on unmanaged Macs
- **Manual firewall**: Required for managed Macs
- **Security**: Use VPN or SSH tunneling for remote access
