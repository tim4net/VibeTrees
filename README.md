# VibeTrees

**Stop switching branches. Start switching contexts.**

Work on multiple features simultaneously‚Äîeach with its own AI assistant, isolated Docker services, and persistent terminals. No more port conflicts, no more stashing work, no more losing your place.

---

## Why VibeTrees?

Ever had to:
- Pause work on a feature to fix an urgent bug?
- Switch branches and lose your terminal history?
- Fight Docker port conflicts between branches?
- Juggle multiple feature branches in your head?

**VibeTrees solves all of this.** Each git worktree gets:
- ‚úÖ Its own AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini)
- ‚úÖ Isolated Docker ports (auto-assigned, no conflicts)
- ‚úÖ Persistent terminal sessions (survive browser refresh)
- ‚úÖ Independent services (databases, APIs, etc.)

Switch between worktrees with one click. Work on 5 features in parallel. Your context stays intact.

## Features

### Multi-Project Management
Manage multiple git repositories from a single VibeTrees instance. Switch between projects seamlessly while keeping all worktrees, terminals, and services isolated per project.

**How it works:**
- One PM2 server manages all projects
- Project dropdown in the sidebar (next to "Worktrees" title)
- Click "+New" to add a new project
- Switch projects instantly‚Äîworktrees auto-load
- Projects persisted to `~/.vibetrees/projects.json`

**Perfect for:**
- Managing multiple client projects
- Working on related microservices
- Switching between work and personal repos
- Testing across different codebases

### Terminal Persistence
Your terminal sessions survive browser crashes. Even system reboots. State is saved every 5 seconds.

### Smart Port Management
VibeTrees automatically assigns unique ports to each worktree's services. No more `EADDRINUSE` errors.

```
main:           API=3000 DB=5432 Console=3001
feature-auth:   API=3002 DB=5433 Console=3003
bugfix-login:   API=3004 DB=5434 Console=3005
```

### Multi-Agent Support
Choose your AI assistant per worktree:
- **Claude Code** - Best for complex refactoring and architecture
- **Codex** - Fast code generation with OpenAI
- **Gemini** - Google's multimodal AI
- **Shell** - Just a terminal, no AI

### Branch Management
- Create worktrees from new or existing branches
- Import worktrees created outside VibeTrees
- Safe branch deletion with merge detection
- Sync with remote and auto-reload services

### Network Sharing
```bash
vibe --listen  # Share with team on your network
```

Shows all IPs to connect from:
```
üåê http://192.168.1.100:3335  (en0)
üåê http://172.16.0.1:3335     (en1)
```

macOS firewall configuration handled automatically (or guided manual setup).
