# Terminal Persistence Testing Plan

**Server Status**: âœ… Running at http://localhost:3335

## Quick Test Sequence

Follow these steps in order to verify all 4 phases of terminal persistence:

---

## Phase 1: Verify PTYSessionManager Integration

**Goal**: Confirm server is using PTYSessionManager

### Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:3335 in your browser
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
3. Click on a worktree (e.g., `feature-database-workflow`)
4. Click "New Terminal" â†’ Select "Claude Code"
5. **Check server logs** for session ID message

### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Server console shows: "Terminal connected: {worktreeName}:claude (session: <uuid>)"
âœ… Terminal opens and shows prompt
âœ… No errors in browser console
```

### What This Tests:
- PTYSessionManager is instantiated correctly
- Sessions are created with unique UUIDs
- WebSocket connection works with new architecture

---

## Phase 2: Verify Session ID Storage

**Goal**: Confirm browser stores session IDs in sessionStorage

### Steps:
1. With terminal open from Phase 1, wait 2-3 seconds
2. In browser DevTools â†’ Console tab, run:
   ```javascript
   // Check for session IDs
   Object.keys(sessionStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('terminal-session'))
   ```
3. You should see something like: `["terminal-session-feature-database-workflow-claude"]`
4. Check the value:
   ```javascript
   sessionStorage.getItem('terminal-session-feature-database-workflow-claude')
   ```
5. You should see a UUID like: `"abc-123-def-456"`

### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Session ID stored with key: "terminal-session-{worktree}-{command}"
âœ… Value is a valid UUID
âœ… Key exists in sessionStorage (not localStorage)
```

### What This Tests:
- Browser saves session IDs after WebSocket handshake
- Storage key format is correct
- sessionStorage (not localStorage) is used

---

## Phase 3: Test Auto-Reconnection

**Goal**: Verify reconnection with exponential backoff

### Test 3A: Network Interruption Simulation

#### Steps:
1. With terminal still open, open DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Find "Throttling" dropdown (usually says "No throttling")
3. Select "Offline" to simulate network loss
4. **Observe terminal behavior**
5. Wait ~5 seconds, then set throttling back to "No throttling"

#### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Reconnection overlay appears with spinner
âœ… Message shows: "Reconnecting... Attempt X of 10"
âœ… Overlay disappears when connection restored
âœ… Terminal continues to work normally
âœ… Browser console shows: "WebSocket reconnected successfully"
```

### Test 3B: Server Restart Simulation

#### Steps:
1. With terminal open, go back to your CLI
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
3. **Observe terminal behavior** (overlay should appear)
4. Restart server: `npm run web`
5. Wait for reconnection

#### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Reconnection overlay appears immediately
âœ… Attempts increment: 1, 2, 3...
âœ… After server restart, connection succeeds
âœ… Terminal becomes responsive again
```

### What This Tests:
- Exponential backoff algorithm (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Visual feedback during reconnection
- Successful reconnection after network restoration
- Error handling after max attempts (if server stays down)

---

## Phase 4: Test Tab Restoration

**Goal**: Verify tabs restore on page refresh

### Test 4A: Basic Tab Restoration

#### Steps:
1. Open multiple terminals:
   - Click worktree â†’ "New Terminal" â†’ "Claude Code"
   - Click worktree â†’ "New Terminal" â†’ "Shell"
   - Click worktree â†’ "Open Logs" â†’ "Combined Logs"
2. Switch between tabs (click each tab)
3. Type some commands in terminals (so you can verify history)
   ```bash
   echo "Test command 1"
   echo "Test command 2"
   ls -la
   ```
4. Note which tab is currently active
5. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R)

#### Expected Results:
```
âœ… All 3 tabs recreate automatically
âœ… Tab labels are correct (Claude Code, Shell, Combined Logs)
âœ… Active tab is reactivated (same tab selected)
âœ… Browser console shows: "Restoring X terminal sessions..."
âœ… Terminal history is preserved (scroll up to see old commands)
```

### Test 4B: Session Validation

#### Steps:
1. Open a terminal for worktree `feature-database-workflow`
2. Note the session ID in sessionStorage (from Phase 2)
3. Delete the worktree (right-click â†’ "Close Worktree")
4. **Refresh the page**
5. Check browser console for cleanup messages

#### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Terminal tab does NOT restore (worktree doesn't exist)
âœ… Console shows: "Session validation failed" or similar
âœ… Invalid session removed from sessionStorage
âœ… No errors thrown
âœ… Page continues to work normally
```

### Test 4C: Session Expiry

#### Steps:
1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Console
2. Manually create an expired session:
   ```javascript
   const expiredSession = {
     tabId: 'tab-expired',
     worktreeName: 'fake-worktree',
     command: 'claude',
     timestamp: Date.now() - (25 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 25 hours ago
   };
   const sessions = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('terminal-sessions') || '[]');
   sessions.push(expiredSession);
   sessionStorage.setItem('terminal-sessions', JSON.stringify(sessions));
   ```
3. **Refresh the page**

#### Expected Results:
```
âœ… Expired session is NOT restored
âœ… Console shows: "Session expired (25 hours old)"
âœ… Expired session removed from sessionStorage
âœ… Other valid sessions still restore normally
```

### What This Tests:
- Tab metadata persistence
- Active tab tracking and restoration
- Session validation before restoration
- 24-hour expiry enforcement
- Graceful cleanup of invalid sessions
- Terminal history preservation (PTY stays alive)

---

## Phase 5: Integration Test (Full Flow)

**Goal**: End-to-end test of all features together

### Steps:
1. **Setup**: Open 3 terminals across 2 different worktrees
2. **Commands**: Run some long-running commands (e.g., `tail -f /dev/null`)
3. **Network Loss**: Set DevTools â†’ Network â†’ Offline
4. **Observe**: Reconnection overlay appears
5. **Network Restore**: Set back to "No throttling"
6. **Observe**: Connection restored
7. **Refresh**: Refresh the page (F5)
8. **Verify**: All tabs restore, commands still running

### Expected Results:
```
âœ… All tabs restored with correct labels
âœ… Long-running commands still executing
âœ… Terminal history preserved
âœ… Active tab reactivated
âœ… Reconnection works after refresh
âœ… No errors in console
```

---

## Debugging Commands

If something doesn't work, use these commands in browser console:

### Check All SessionStorage
```javascript
// List all keys
Object.keys(sessionStorage)

// View all terminal-related data
Object.keys(sessionStorage)
  .filter(k => k.includes('terminal'))
  .forEach(k => console.log(k, sessionStorage.getItem(k)))
```

### Check Session List
```javascript
JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('terminal-sessions') || '[]')
```

### Check Active Tab
```javascript
sessionStorage.getItem('active-terminal-tab')
```

### Clear All Sessions (Reset)
```javascript
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Monitor WebSocket Messages
```javascript
// Enable verbose WebSocket logging (if available)
localStorage.setItem('debug-websocket', 'true')
```

## Known Issues / Expected Behavior

1. **Docker Compose Error**: The main worktree doesn't have `docker-compose.yml`, so you'll see an error trying to start services. This is normal and doesn't affect terminal testing.

2. **Session Cleanup Timing**: The 24-hour cleanup runs on the server every hour. You won't see immediate cleanup unless you manually trigger it or wait.

3. **WebSocket Reconnection**: First reconnection attempt happens after 1 second. Subsequent attempts use exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max).

4. **Terminal Buffer Limits**: Very large terminal buffers (>10k lines) may take a moment to restore. This is expected behavior.

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. âœ… Commit the changes
2. âœ… Update CLAUDE.md with terminal persistence feature
3. âœ… Merge feature branch (if using one)
4. âœ… Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
